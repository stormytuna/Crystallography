Crystallography

This is Roton, ILoveWater, and stormytuna's submission for tModJam #0! With the theme of "A study of one", we chose Crystallography as the basis for our mod.

We're unable to fix any issues for the first week of release as per the tModJam rules, sorry!

TLDR
- Explore the underground to find new Geodes which drop Magically Enhanced Gems with random purity levels
- Acquire 8 unique Artifact accessories, and slot in Gems to activate their effects
- 8 different effect groups, with 22 Major and 27 Minor effects
- Find an effect you don't like? Reroll it in the Gemball Machine
- Multiplayer compatible
